  {
    question: "What is a TTML maker?",
    answer:
      "A TTML maker is a tool that turns plain lyrics and an audio file into a Timed Text Markup Language file, the format used by Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music for synchronized lyrics. RichLyricEditor handles tap-to-sync, word-level timing, and export so you never write the XML by hand.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to install anything to make a TTML file?",
    answer:
      "No. RichLyricEditor runs in your browser. Drop an audio file in, paste your lyrics, sync, and download the TTML. There is no signup, no install, and your audio never leaves your machine.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make word-level or just line-level TTML?",
    answer:
      "Both. Start in line-sync mode to capture the skeleton, then refine into word-level timing whenever a section needs per-word animation. You can switch at any point.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the TTML I make work with Apple Music?",
    answer:
      "Yes. RichLyricEditor outputs the Apple-flavored TTML structure with ttm:agent for multi-voice lines and ttm:role for background vocals, matching what Apple Music ingests.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import an existing LRC or eLRC file and convert it?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Drop an LRC or eLRC file into the import view and RichLyricEditor parses the timings, including inline word timestamps, so you can touch up in the timeline and export straight to TTML.",
  },
