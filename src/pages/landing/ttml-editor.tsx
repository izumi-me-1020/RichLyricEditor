  {
    question:
      "What makes RichLyricEditor a real TTML editor and not just a generator?",
    answer:
      "Every word has a draggable boundary over a zoomable waveform. You can nudge timing by a single millisecond, split and merge syllables, swap agents, and edit background vocal spans in place. Generators only produce; RichLyricEditor lets you shape.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I open an existing TTML file and edit it?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Drop a TTML file in and RichLyricEditor parses agents, word-level spans, background vocals, and metadata. You can refine it and re-export without losing structure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does RichLyricEditor support undo and history?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every timing adjustment, text edit, agent change, and split or merge is undoable. History is preserved per session.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I edit lyrics and timing at the same time?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Changing lyrics text preserves timing on matching words by content first, then by position, so your sync work survives typo fixes and spelling changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What file formats can I import into the TTML editor?",
    answer:
      "TTML, LRC, eLRC (with inline word timing), SRT, and plain text. RichLyricEditor detects the format and imports with maximum fidelity.",
  },
