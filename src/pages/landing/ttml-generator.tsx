const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What does a TTML generator do?",
    answer:
      "It turns audio and text into a Timed Text Markup Language file. RichLyricEditor captures timing as you tap along with the track, then serializes a valid TTML document complete with agent metadata and word-level spans.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I generate TTML without timing anything myself?",
    answer:
      "If you already have timing data in LRC, eLRC, SRT, or a source TTML, RichLyricEditor maps it to the target TTML structure automatically. For fresh lyrics you still need to tap to sync, but it takes minutes, not hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the generated TTML valid for Apple Music and Spotify?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The output includes the xml, ttml, and ttm namespaces, agent declarations, and the span structure these services expect.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can RichLyricEditor generate word-level timing automatically from a single line tap?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you only tap line begins, RichLyricEditor distributes word timing proportionally to character length. You can then refine whichever words need fixing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the generator support non-English lyrics?",
    answer:
      "Yes. RichLyricEditor treats word splits based on whitespace and user-defined split characters, so it handles most languages with word-based scripts.",
  },
