const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Does Spotify use TTML for synced lyrics?",
    answer:
      "Spotify's lyrics infrastructure accepts TTML as part of its standard lyrics ingestion. RichLyricEditor produces standards-compliant TTML that downstream aggregators can package for Spotify delivery.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get synced lyrics on Spotify?",
    answer:
      "Lyrics are typically delivered to Spotify through Musixmatch or other licensed partners. RichLyricEditor authors the TTML; your distribution partner handles delivery. For independent releases, check with your distributor about their lyrics submission workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "What granularity does Spotify support?",
    answer:
      "Both line-synced and word-synced lyrics are supported. Word-synced produces the animated highlighting you see during playback. RichLyricEditor lets you mix granularities on the same song.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I author TTML for Spotify without also producing an LRC file?",
    answer:
      "Yes. TTML is a superset of what LRC expresses, so a well-formed TTML file is sufficient. If you also need LRC for another service, RichLyricEditor exports straight from the same project.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Spotify TTML different from Apple Music TTML?",
    answer:
      "The core structure is the same. Apple Music uses more extensions for background vocals and agents; Spotify lyrics tend to be simpler in practice. RichLyricEditor can produce either profile from one project.",
  },
