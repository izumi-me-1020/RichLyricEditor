const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What format does Apple Music use for synced lyrics?",
    answer:
      "Apple Music uses TTML (Timed Text Markup Language) with word-level spans, ttm:agent declarations for multi-voice songs, and ttm:role='x-bg' for background vocals. RichLyricEditor produces exactly this structure.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I submit synced lyrics to Apple Music?",
    answer:
      "Rights holders submit lyrics through Apple's Content Collector tools or directly via an aggregator. RichLyricEditor handles the authoring side; the platform you use for delivery to Apple handles ingestion.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can RichLyricEditor handle duets and featured artists?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every line is assigned to an agent. Add as many agents as the song needs, including 'person', 'group', or 'character' types, and RichLyricEditor serializes them into the TTML ttm:agent metadata Apple Music expects.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are background vocals and ad libs represented?",
    answer:
      "RichLyricEditor wraps them in a ttm:role='x-bg' container span. Inner word spans carry the timing. This matches the structure Apple Music uses for the smaller, muted lyric line shown alongside the main line.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to time every single word for Apple Music?",
    answer:
      "Apple Music supports both line-synced and word-synced lyrics. Word-synced gets the animated 'sing-along' presentation. RichLyricEditor lets you choose the granularity and switch whenever you want.",
