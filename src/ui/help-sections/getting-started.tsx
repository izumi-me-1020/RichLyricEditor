      <div>
        <h4 className={HEADING}>1. Import your audio</h4>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Drop an audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC) into the Import tab, or paste a YouTube URL to pull the audio
          from a video. Local files can also be dropped straight onto the Timeline. The waveform appears once the audio
          loads.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className={HEADING}>2. Add your lyrics</h4>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          Go to the Edit tab and type or paste your lyrics, one line per row. If you have a lyrics file (.lrc, .srt,
          .ttml, .txt), drop it there instead. You can also use{" "}
          <InlineKeyBadge keys={getEffectiveKeysArray("timeline.importLyrics")} /> in Timeline to import lyrics without
          leaving that view.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className={HEADING}>3. Sync the timing</h4>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          The Sync tab lets you sync words to the music using two keys: tap Space to mark gapless word boundaries, or
          hold F to capture a word's full duration. You can also tap Space while holding F to create gapless syllable
          boundaries. If you miss one, use the arrow keys to nudge the timing. For finer control, switch to Timeline and
          drag word blocks directly on the waveform.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className={HEADING}>4. Preview and export</h4>
        <p className={PROSE}>
          The Preview tab shows a live karaoke-style playback of your work. When you're happy with it, go to Export and
          download your TTML file. You can also copy the raw XML or export a project file to share with someone else.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p className={PROSE}>
      The tabs are meant to be followed left-to-right, but you can jump between them anytime using {MOD_KEY} + 1 through
      6.
